# ImageAI

ImageAI is a free API for generating images based on user-provided prompts, seeds, and steps. This project allows users to input specific metadata and receive an AI-generated image in return.
(because every company LOVES shoving AI down their customer's throats!)

## Notice

[!WARNING]
> The ImageAI Demo will only be active for a short period of time so voters on High Seas can see a real-world example.
> This service will likely be shutdown very soon after this voting period.
> Currently, ImageAI is available to demo. (this will change however)
